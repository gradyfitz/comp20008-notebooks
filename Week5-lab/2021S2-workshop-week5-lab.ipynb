    "# Elements Of Data Processing (2021S2) - Week 5\n",
    "\n",
    "### Regular Expressions (Regex)\n",
    "- Regular expressions allow you to match patterns in strings, rather than matching exact characters.  \n",
    "- For example, if I wanted to find all phone numbers with form `(03) xxxx xxxx`, where `x` is some arbitrary digit, then I could use a regular expression like this: \n",
    "    - `\\(03\\) \\d\\d\\d\\d \\d\\d\\d\\d` \n",
    "    - `\\(03\\) \\d{4} \\d{4}` where `\\d{4}` matches a digit exactly 4 times\n",
    "- Here's a good tutorial on Python regex: https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_regex.asp\n",
    "- and a website to test your regex expressions with test cases: https://regex101.com/\n",
    "\n",
    "### Regex with Python\n",
    "- The `re` library in Python allows you to use regular expressions. \n",
    "- Methods of note are:\n",
    "    - `.search()` (search for a particular pattern given a string)\n",
    "    - `.findall()` (finds all substrings that match a given pattern)\n",
    "    - `.sub()` (replaces all matched substrings with another given substring)\n",
    "    \n",
    "### Regex Quantifiers\n",
    "- `?`: exactly zero or one occurrences of the preceding element\n",
    "- `*`: zero or more occurrences of the preceding element\n",
    "- `+`: one or more occurrences of the preceding element\n",
    "- `{n}`: preceding item is matched exactly `n` times\n",
    "- `{,n}`: preceding item is matched up to `n` times inclusive\n",
    "- `{n,}`: preceding item is matched at least `n` or more times\n",
    "- `{m,n}`: preceding item is matched at least `m` or more times, but up to `n` times inclusive\n",
    "    \n",
    "### Escaping Special Characters\n",
    "- Like special characters in Python (i.e `\\n`), you will also need to escape special characters in regex.\n",
    "- For example, if you wanted to match a literal bracket `(`, you have to type `\\(` to escape it as `()` in regex is used to capture a literal group of characters\n",
    "    \n",
    "Consider the phone number from the example above."

Now we are engaged in a great civil war, testing whether that nation, or any nation so conceived and so dedicated, can long endure. We are met on a great battle-field of that war. We have come to dedicate a portion of that field, as a final resting place for those who here gave their lives that that nation might live. It is altogether fitting and proper that we should do this. But, in a larger sense, we can not dedicate -- we can not consecrate -- we can not hallow -- this ground. The brave men, living and dead, who struggled here, have consecrated it, far above our poor power to add or detract. The world will little note, nor long remember what we say here, but it can never forget what they did here. It is for us the living, rather, to be dedicated here to the unfinished work which they who fought here have thus far so nobly advanced. It is rather for us to be here dedicated to the great task remaining before us -- that from these honored dead we take increased devotion to that cause for which they gave the last full measure of devotion -- that we here highly resolve that these dead shall not have died in vain -- that this nation, under God, shall have a new birth of freedom -- and that government of the people, by the people, for the people, shall not perish from the earth.'\n",
